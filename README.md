# rockPaperScissors
Game that will be played on the console

For this project, we will create a game Rock Paper Scissors. This game will be played entirely in the console. During the coding of this project we will be challenged to take on a problem solving approach for each step.

Let's have fun!

Steps for the creation of the game: 

1- Write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”
    - Create an array of words
    - Write a function that randomly selects one of these words
    - Ensure the function returns the selected words

2- Write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.

3- Write variables to keep track of the players score.

4- Write a function that:
    - takes the human and computer player choices as arguments
    - plays a single round
    - increments the round winner’s score
    - logs a winner announcement

5- Write a function named playGame that:
    - calls playRound to play 5 rounds
    - Keeps track of the scores 
    - Declares a winner at the end.
